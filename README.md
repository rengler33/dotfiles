A few settings files for my current development setup

I'm running Windows 10, using WSL2 with Ubuntu for development.

I prefer to use Docker Desktop and configure Pycharm to use that as a remote interpreter. I also develop with VS Code in a similar way.

Project files are kept inside a WSL2 folder location.
